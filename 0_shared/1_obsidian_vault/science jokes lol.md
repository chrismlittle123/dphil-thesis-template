DAD JOKES FROM LAB (help me):

why don't statisticians like one night stands?
- they need a larger sample size!!!!! 

what did the cell say when his sister stepped on his foot?
- mitosis!!!

why can't you trust atoms?
- they make up everything lololol

epidemiologist walks into bar:
- reduces everyone's risk factors

two scientists walk into a bar
- you'd think one of them would have seen it
- probably needed peer review

why did the bacteria cross the microscope?
- to get to the other slide!!!!

what do you call an epidemiologist who only studies height?
- a tall-order study!!!!!!

statistics pickup lines (NEVER USE THESE):
- hey baby, are you a p-value? cause you're significant
- wanna increase my sample size?
- are you a confidence interval? cause you've got me at 95%
- let's not be independent variables tonight
- you must be the alternative hypothesis cause i'm rejecting H0

found these in my lab notebook why did i write these down
