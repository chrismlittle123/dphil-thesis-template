Day 847 of observing my human:

still does the weird typing thing all day. suspect trying to communicate with invisible beings through glowing rectangle.

today's observations:
- stared at papers for 3 hours
- talked to glowing rectangle again
- consumed 7 cups of bitter water
- made stressed noises at "R studio"
- forgot to feed me AGAIN

hypothesis: human broken. possible solutions:
- sit on papers
- walk across keyboard
- knock water off desk
- meow louder
- attack feet under desk

progress report:
- knocked over 3 books
- deleted 4 hours of work (improvement from yesterday)
- successfully added "kjhgfdsa" to thesis
- achieved maximum chaos

tomorrow's agenda:
- sleep on laptop (warm)
- ignore new toy
- demand food at 3am
- throw up in shoes
