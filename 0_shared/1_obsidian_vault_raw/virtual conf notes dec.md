online epi thing (missed half bc zoom crashed)

keynote:
- something about machine learning in epidemiology
- cool forest plots
- missed the methods part (internet died)
- q&a was interesting but forgot to screenshot

parallel session 3 (or was it 4??):
- causal inference stuff
- propensity scores debate got heated
- someone's cat walked across their camera
- recording available for 2 weeks (download!!!)

breakout room chaos:
- got put in wrong room twice
- someone shared interesting preprint (find in chat history)
- discussion about missing data
- someone's mic was terrible

links from chat:

(copy these before they expire)

need to follow up:
- that R package everyone mentioned
- something about time-varying confounding
- new journal launching soon?
- virtual networking thing (skip maybe)
