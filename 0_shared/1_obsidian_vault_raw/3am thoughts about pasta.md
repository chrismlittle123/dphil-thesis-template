if you really think about it... pasta is just sad bread

profound pasta thoughts:
- spaghetti is just long rice
- ravioli = italian dumplings???
- penne = hollow spaghetti PROVE ME WRONG
- macaroni is just elbow pasta (why not knee pasta???)
- who decided on these shapes
- what if pasta was cube shaped
- do italians dream in pasta

questions that need answers:
- is cereal soup?
- is hotdog sandwich?
- if you cook pasta in soup is it still pasta?
- what if you cook pasta in coffee

time is just spicy pasta when you think about it

note: buy more coffee
