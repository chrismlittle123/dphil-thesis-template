causal inference workshop (day 2? 3?)

morning session:
- DAGs all over the place
- something about backdoor paths
- coffee was amazing
- lost track after slide 57
- borrowed pen from person next to me (return it?)

afternoon practical:
- R code didn't work
- everyone confused about exercise 3
- that one person knew all the answers
- instructor said something important but was checking email

useful stuff maybe:
- new DAG drawing software
- reference for sensitivity analysis
- someone's github repo
- course materials online somewhere

random thoughts:
- hotel wifi terrible
- found good stroopwafel place
- met someone doing smoking research
- raining again
- missed last train

todo:
- email instructor about that thing
- find those slides about assumptions
- practice drawing DAGs
- figure out what M-bias is
