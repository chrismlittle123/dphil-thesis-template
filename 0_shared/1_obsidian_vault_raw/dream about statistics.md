last night's fever dream:

p-values were chasing me through forest of error bars
- null hypothesis was hiding behind trees
- confidence intervals kept getting wider
- standard deviations were whispering
- mean was meaningless
- median was plotting against mode

regression line turned into snake:
- r-squared was its eyes
- residuals falling like rain
- heteroscedasticity everywhere
- outliers watching from distance
- correlation implying causation!!!

then suddenly:
- histograms started dancing
- box plots opened like mouths
- scatter plots scattered
- pie charts ate each other
- normal distribution went skewed

woke up screaming "BUT THE SAMPLE SIZE!!!"

note: no more stats before bed
