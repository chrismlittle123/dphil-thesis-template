- picture of perfect normal distribution
- caption: reality is often disappointing

slide 2: "me explaining my methodology"
- confused math lady meme
- add error bars for extra confusion

slide 3: "reviewing literature like"
- that galaxy brain meme
- level 1: reading abstracts
- level 2: reading methods
- level 3: citing without reading
- level 4: making up papers

slide 4: "my research progress"
- expectation: nice linear graph
- reality: drawing of dumpster fire

slide 5: "types of academic emails"
- "as per my previous email" = fight me
- "please advise" = help everything broken
- "kind regards" = i hate you
- "best wishes" = neutral
- "warm regards" = trying too hard
- "best" = too busy for full words

don't forget:
- add comic sans for maximum chaos
- animate everything
- rainbow color scheme
- make every bullet point fly in
- add unnecessary sound effects

note: maybe save this for april 1st presentation
