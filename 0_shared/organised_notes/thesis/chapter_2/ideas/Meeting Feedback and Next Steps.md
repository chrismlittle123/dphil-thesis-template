J said something about control groups being weird
- maybe exclude the ones who changed meds?
- check w ethics about this
- numbers might be too small then???

M wasn't happy about the graphs
- "too busy" whatever that means
- remove the dotted lines?
- color scheme needs work
- axis labels confusing apparently

Todo:
- that paper everyone kept mentioning
- redo analysis without the weird participants
- send something to someone about something (check email thread)
- coffee rota???

Next time:
- preliminary results
- that other thing
- update on recruitment

Side note: someone's birthday next week? bring cake maybe
